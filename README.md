# Within the realm of programming, a generator is a routine that is used to control interaction within a loop. 
# Generators are useful when you want to produce a large sequence of values without storing them in memory at once. 
# The ability to create a large sequence without using up memory is important, especially when dealing with Python programs that generate a large amount of information, such as a long sequence of numbers.
